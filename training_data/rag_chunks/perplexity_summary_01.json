It's not just about answering questionsâ€”it's about empowering you to do more, whether you're looking to summarize content, explore new topics, or even get a little creative.\n\n**Key Positioning**: Basically, it's a general AI assistant that is grounded in truth. This makes it particularly valuable for research, learning, and decision-making where accuracy matters.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**: Unlike traditional chatbots, Perplexity specializes in search functionality and provides source citations, making it ideal for research-heavy tasks.",
